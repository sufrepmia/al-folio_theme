Welcome! This is Yuan Sui's personal website and you can see my brief information here. Currently I am a junior in `PKU` learning physics, and now I am highly interested in `physics-related engineering` fields, such as ee, material science, energy engineering, robots, etc. Besides this page, there are other three pages on my website:

The `CV` page includes my brief information of education, experience, interest and my `personal statement`. If you are interested, please see the PDF version. 

The `Research` page have some small projects (such as research study, data analyzing/simulation and talks) which I worked on, and the recent project is updating.

The `Courses` page records some of my advanced courses assignment which is devided into subjects and topics, to view the details please directly see the PDF file.

You can reach this site by `www.yuansui.website` or `sufrepmia.netlify.app`. Please contact me by sending email to `suiyuan@stu.pku.edu.cn` or `sufrepmia@gmail.com`. Thank you!
