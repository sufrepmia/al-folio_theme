Currently I am a junior student in Peking University, conducting a research project on the characterization and transport properties of novel materials. Now my research interests are concentrated in applied physics and emerging engineering fields and I have been well prepared during university studies: I have a good ability in physics/mathematics and technical skills by performing well in physics, mathematics, programming and laboratory courses; Through paper research, communication and presentation, data analyzing and experimental operation exercises in undergraduate research and other projects/courses, I believe I have the ability to quickly learn and apply new knowledge. Therefore, I want to improve my ability and cultivate interest by trying and challenging more research fields.
